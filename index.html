            <br>The game I designed revolves around the user collecting fuel for his/her spaceship and navigating the spaceship through space avoiding asteroids and meteorites along the way. The user has 3 lives to begin with and the game ends when the life count reaches 0. I chose to design my game this way because I will be able to incorporate most of what was learnt in this module over the course of the semester such as<br>
            <li>Arrays
            <li>Event listeners
            <li>Reinitiating an object's position
            <li>setIntervals
            <li>Conditions to be met before something should be done
            <li>Timers
            <li>Incorporating sounds
            <li>Loops
            <li>Prompt for difficulty levels
            <li>Alerts
            <br>
            <br>I've used arrays to create the asteroids and fuel pieces, moving them using while loops, and repositioning them by reinitiating their position after a certain amount of time. Event listeners were used allow the user to control the spaceship and user's fuel unit during the games. setIntervals were used to update the position of the asteroids as well as to update the stats of the game, such as lives left, distance travelled, fuel remaining, total distance and highscore. Conditions such as to reduce a life and end the round when the user's mouse position hits an asteroid, or to increase the size of the user controlled fuel and increase the amount of fuel the user has when he/she hits another unit that is smaller than his unit, and reposition the smaller unit back to a random position, were also set. Timers were used to set the distance travelled and to reduce the fuel accordingly after a certain amount of time. Music were used to enhance user experience, making the game more enjoyable and reducing dull moments. The music and sound effects were chosen based on their relevance to the respective activities. Prompt was used to allow the user to set the difficulty level and alerts are used to let the user know of important events which happened, such as change of difficulty and the loss of a life.
            <br>
            <br>I started this code with the array assignment we did in class, but ultimately did quite a few major changes to the initial code. I've also changed the layout of the page to only include 1 div, which will be the div where the game will be placed within. I've also styled the page to suit the space theme of the game. I did not include a title text within the page as I've included a title screen in my game and had named the title of the browser page the game name. I've changed the cursor style into a crosshair when the user is playing the game activities to allow better precision when playing the game.
            <br>
            <br>I set up an array of asteroids, initiating their position to be outside of the paper, and give them random speed using a random math equation, moving in the same direction. The random speed allows me to create the illusion of the user flying in space. I loop them, repositioning them back to a random position outside of the paper after a certain amount of time, as what we had learnt in class. This allows less objects to be created and basically have the same effect. Using pythagoras theorm, I then calculated the distance between the x and y position of the object and the cursor position, and coded the user to crash once the distance is lesser than the size of the object. This creates the effect of crashing when the user touches the asteroid. I set up intervals to regularly increase the distance by 10*the speed (difficulty) setting the user had chosen every 10ms and reduce the fuel by 5% ever 5 seconds. I've also added a back to main menu button to allow the user to exit the game whenever he/she wants to.
            <br>
            <br>The fuels were similarly created with arrays and repositioned by looping. The difference in this segment is that the user's unit would grow by 10px when it hits another unit that is detected to be smaller. The distance was calculated with pythagoras and the size was calculated by comparing the width and length of the objects. The smaller fuel is then repositioned instead of removed to allow a constant flow of units for the user to capture. Each capture increases the fuel by 5% and the back to main menu button was added into this game as well.
            <br>
            <br>I used the concept of speed to set the difficulty level to suit the theme of the game. The difficulty level is then used to control the speed of the asteroids, altering the difficulty of the game. The distance travelled is also affected by the difficulty setting, with a higher setting resulting in a faster incrementation of speed to provide better rewards for playing the game on a harder difficulty.
            <br>
            <br>The sounds I've used were retrieved from http://freesounds.org, and were chosen based on their suitability and relevancy to the theme and activity of the game.
            <br>
            <br>Callback functions were used to set up what the buttons do, and some math equations. This is because some functions can be called by a number of buttons and this allows it to be done using the minimal effort, also allowing me to edit a certain function once and have the effect change for all the applications the function can be used for. Interval timer were used as most of my game requires regular update of either the position of value of certain variables as the game progresses.
            <br>
            <br>One thing I've learnt while doing this project would be figuring out the method to see if the objects made contact with each other and to adjust certain values based on these conditions. I've also noticed that I am able to figure out the issue with the code when I ran into problems by thinking logically about what would cause the problem to happen and which variables it affects.
            <br>
            <br>What I feel can be improved on would be the position and intensity of the asteroids, as well as the size and rate of the fuel units. These were all done by issuing random numbers generated and would sometimes have inappropriate or weird frequencies and positions. Perhaps these could be done by creating a few arrays for each set of unit and issuing a more specific value to each array, ultimately creating a variety of more constant values. Another possible way to improve the site would be to use smaller images in order to allow the page to load faster.
            <br>
            <br>All in all, this project allowed me to utilize most of what I had learnt in this module, and also allowed me to think outside the box to figure out how to achieve certain effects as well as how to solve certain problems during the process.
