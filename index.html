            <h4>Game Concept</h4>
            The game I designed revolves around the user collecting fuel for his/her spaceship and navigating the spaceship through space avoiding asteroids and meteorites along the way. The user has 3 lives to begin with and the game ends when the life count reaches 0. I chose to design my game this way because I will be able to incorporate most of what was learnt in this module over the course of the semester such as<br>
            <li>Arrays: Create asteroids and fuel pieces
            <li>Event listeners: Button clicks and updating of object's position based on mouse position
            <li>Reinitiating an object's position: Provide constant supply of units, moving them back to the start after they move out of screen
            <li>setIntervals: Moving the objects as well as updating the fuel and score of the player
            <li>If/else statements: Determine what actions should be done, for example, ending the game if life is 0, else allow the user to go back to main menu, or end the round if user crashes
            <li>Timers: Constant update of fuel and score using intervals
            <li>Incorporating sounds: To provide ambience increase excitement
            <li>Loops: Usilg while loops to update position of the objects
            <li>Prompt: To set difficulty levels
            <li>Alerts: To let the user know when something happens
            <br>
            <br><h4>Sounds, Texts and Images</h4>
            The sounds I've used were retrieved from http://freesounds.org, and were chosen based on their suitability and relevancy to the theme and activity of the game.. Texts used in this game were mostly created by adding text elements on the paper, in order to ensure proper readability, as texts created on pictures before being uploaded would be distorted. The images used were mostly gotten from Google image searches, and edited using Photoshop accordingly.
            <br>
            <br><h4>Starting Code and Styling</h4>
            I started this code with the array assignment we did in class, but ultimately did quite a few major changes to the initial code. I've also changed the layout of the page to only include 1 div, which will be the div where the game will be placed within. I've also styled the page to suit the space theme of the game. I did not include a title text within the page as I've included a title screen in my game and had named the title of the browser page the game name. I've changed the cursor style into a crosshair when the user is playing the game activities to allow better precision when playing the game.
            <br>
            <br><h4>Instructions</h4>
            The instruction pages were created by hiding and showing the relevant background, button image and text elements on each page, done by calling the respective functions based on which button is pressed. I've chosen to place the instructions in a single page instead of showing them before the game activities as I feel that it would be a hassle if the instructions were to be shown on every subsequent attempts at the game, as the user would only be interested in the instructions to know how to play the game during his/her initial visits and attempts at the game.
            <br>This way, I am able to allow users who had played the game before to be able to jump straight into the game with minimal clicks.
            <br>
            <br><h4>Flight Navigation</h4>
            I set up an array of asteroids, initiating their position to be outside of the paper, and give them random speed using a random math equation, moving in the same direction. The random speed allows me to create the illusion of the user flying in space. I loop them, repositioning them back to a random position outside of the paper after a certain amount of time, as what we had learnt in class. This allows less objects to be created and basically have the same effect. 
            <br>Using pythagoras theorm, I then calculated the distance between the x and y position of the object and the cursor position, and coded the user to crash once the distance is lesser than the size of the object, initiating an explosion sound and reducing a life, before ending the round. This creates the effect of crashing when the user touches the asteroid. I also set up intervals to regularly increase the distance by 10*the speed (difficulty) setting the user had chosen every 10ms and reduce the fuel by 5% ever 5 seconds. I've also added a back to main menu button to allow the user to exit the game whenever he/she wants to. If the user crashes and has 0 lives left, the gamve over screen would show, else, the user would be able to return to the main menu. This is done using the if/else statements in the code to detect the various conditions.
            <br>
            <br><h4>Fuel Collection</h4>
            The fuels were similarly created with arrays and repositioned by looping. The difference in this segment is that the user's unit would grow by 10px when it hits another unit that is detected to be smaller. The distance was calculated with pythagoras and the size was calculated by comparing the width and length of the objects. 
            <br>The smaller fuel is then repositioned instead of removed to allow a constant flow of units for the user to capture. Each capture would play a sound clip and also increases the fuel by 5%. If the user hits a unit that is larger than his user controlled unit, an explosion sound would play and the user would lose a life, ending the round. Similarly to Flight Navigation, the game over screen will appear if the life hits 0, or else the user would be able to return to the main menu, done using if/else statements. 
            <br>The back to main menu button was added into this game as well to allow the user to exit the game if he/she chooses to. 
            <br>
            <br><h4>Difficulty Setting</h4>
            I used the concept of speed to set the difficulty level to suit the theme of the game. The difficulty level is then used to control the speed of the asteroids, altering the difficulty of the game. The distance travelled is also affected by the difficulty setting, with a higher setting resulting in a faster incrementation of speed to provide better rewards for playing the game on a harder difficulty.
            <br>
            <br><h4>Functions</h4>
            Callback functions were used to set up what the buttons do, and some math equations. This is because some functions can be called by a number of buttons and this allows it to be done using the minimal effort, also allowing me to edit a certain function once and have the effect change for all the applications the function can be used for. Interval timer were used as most of my game requires regular update of either the position of value of certain variables as the game progresses.
            <br>
            <br><h4>Lessons learnt</h4>
            One thing I've learnt while doing this project would be figuring out the method to see if the objects made contact with each other and to adjust certain values based on these conditions. I've also noticed that I am able to figure out the issue with the code when I ran into problems by thinking logically about what would cause the problem to happen and which variables it affects. I also found out the importance of altering and rearranging your code so during testing so that you would be able to test the parts you want to test instead of going through the whole game to test a certain portion.
            <br>I've also figured out how to make the asteroids move more consistently. This can be done by initiating the dots to be placed over a very wide range of positions so as to avoid cluttering during the game, and the repositions can be placed at a narrower range as they will be repositioned at a slower rate than the initial rate. 
            <br>
            <br><h4>Improvements</h4>
            What I feel can be improved on would be the position and intensity of the asteroids, as well as the size and rate of the fuel units. These were all done by issuing random numbers generated and would sometimes have inappropriate or weird frequencies and positions. Perhaps these could be done by creating a few arrays for each set of unit and issuing a more specific value to each array, ultimately creating a variety of more constant values. Another possible way to improve the site would be to use smaller images in order to allow the page to load faster, as I realized that it takes quite a while to load the title page when visiting the page for the first time.
            <br>
            <br><h4>Conclusion</h4>
            All in all, this project allowed me to utilize most of what I had learnt in this module, and also allowed me to think outside the box to figure out how to achieve certain effects as well as how to solve certain problems during the process.
